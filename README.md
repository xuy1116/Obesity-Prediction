#1: Introduction
Obesity is a significant and growing public health concern. America has a high prevalence of obesity compared to many other regions. Obesity is a major risk factor for numerous chronic diseases. 
A comprehensive understanding of the contributing factors to obesity is essential for the development of interventions aimed at reducing obesity prevalence. 
This will have the beneficial effect of mitigating economic costs and improving individual productivity.

this project uses a Kaggle dataset for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition.
The data contains 17 attributes and 2111 records, the records are labeled with the class variable NObesity (Obesity Level), that allows classification of the data using the values of Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III.
